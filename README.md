Reinforcement learning

📈 Stock Trading Agent using Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based stock trading bot built with TensorFlow and Keras using LSTM layers. It learns to buy/sell/hold stocks to maximize profit through self-play and experience replay.

🧠 Features
Deep Q-Learning with LSTM networks

Custom Stock Trading Environment

Dynamic action selection: Buy, Sell, Hold

Reward based on net profit

Scalable to any stock CSV data

Visualization of training rewards and trading decisions
